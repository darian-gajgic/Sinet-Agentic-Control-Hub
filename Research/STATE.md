# Campaign state — live pointer

> Any session resuming the campaign: read this file first, then `CAMPAIGN.md`, then follow `.claude/skills/research-campaign/SKILL.md`. Update this file before and after every action. This file is the single source of truth for progress.

**Campaign status:** SETUP COMPLETE — awaiting G0 launch decision.
**Next action:** operator answers G0 (launch mode). Then: run T01 pilot (Mode A, Mode B fallback).
**Last updated:** 2026-07-16 (setup session).

## Gate log

| Gate | Subject | Status | Decision | Recorded in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0 | Launch: pilot-first vs review-first vs full Wave A | **OPEN** | — | (this file, below) |
| G1 | Architecture direction (after Wave A) | pending | — | decisions/GATE-1-*.md |
| G2 | Substrate + adoption list (after Wave B) | pending | — | decisions/GATE-2-*.md |
| G3 | Spec-readiness (after Wave C) | pending | — | decisions/GATE-3-*.md |
| G4 | Spec review → end research phase | pending | — | decisions/GATE-4-*.md |

## Topic board

Statuses: `pending` → `ready` (brief final, wave unblocked) → `running` (agent launched) → `saved` (report written, validating) → `committed` (validated + committed + pushed) → `gated` (reviewed at its gate).

## Session log

- **2026-07-16 — setup session (Fable 5):** read all Docs/, probed subagent skill access (deep-research available in subagents → Mode A viable), built campaign plan, 16 briefs, gate template, coordinator skill. G0 presented to operator.
